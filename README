A very limited version of a way to automate changing enemy growth rates in the GBA Fire Emblem games.
The Nightmare modding program, as well as the relevant Nightmare modules, are required to use this program.

At the moment, it's only functionality is to change all enemies' stat growth rates, either by increasing, decreasing, or setting them to a specified value.
The program also lacks the functionality to take varied/custom inputs, and the absolute paths to both the ROM in question and the Nightmare module need to be hardcoded in.
The program has also at this point only been tested on FE8, although it is probably compatible with the other two GBA games with a few changes in constants (namely, the NUM_CLASSES variable, since FE6 & FE7 lack any monster classes).
The program also always changes the growth rates uniformly and for every class. At some point I'd like to allow the user to choose particular classes/units if desired.

In the future I'd like to make the program responsive/interactive, where you are prompted to choose the paths to the relevant ROM/module, as well as specify what growth rate changes should occur.
I'd also like to extend this into altering the growth rate of player-controlled units, which would likely be quite easy to implement, as all functions have been implemented with this in mind from the beginning.
I'd also like to find a way to run the program as a background task, rather than having the user be blocked from using the PC for it to run properly. Since filling in each field for each class can be quite slow, 
  you basically have to leave your computer for an extended period to allow it to run/finish properly. To address this, I'll need to have it run in the background, have it run a lot faster, or allow the user to stop/start a job at multiple points.
