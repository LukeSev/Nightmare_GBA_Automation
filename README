A very limited version of a way to automate changing enemy growth rates in the GBA Fire Emblem games.
The Nightmare modding program, as well as the relevant Nightmare modules, are required to use this program.

At the moment, it's only functionality is to change all enemies' stat growth rates, either by increasing, decreasing, or setting them to a specified value.
The program also lacks the functionality to take varied/custom inputs, and the absolute paths to both the ROM in question and the Nightmare module need to be hardcoded in.
The program has also at this point only been tested on FE8, although it is probably compatible with the other two GBA games with a few changes in constants (namely, the NUM_CLASSES variable, since FE6 & FE7 lack any monster classes).

In the future I'd like to make the program responsive/interactive, where you are prompted to choose the paths to the relevant ROM/module, as well as specify what growth rate changes should occur.
I'd also like to extend this into altering the growth rate of player-controlled units, which would likely be quite easy to implement, as all functions have been implemented with this in mind from the beginning.
